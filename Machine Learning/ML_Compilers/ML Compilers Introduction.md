# ML Compilers Introduction

An overview of ML Compilers and their fundamental role in machine learning workflows.

## What are ML Compilers?

ML compilers bridge the gap between high-level machine learning models and the hardware they run on. They serve two primary functions:

- **Lowering**: Generate hardware-native code for your models to enable execution on specific hardware
- **Optimizing**: Enhance model performance through various optimization techniques tailored to target hardware

As Chip Huyen notes: "Understanding how compilers work can help you choose the right compiler to bring your models to your hardware of choice as well as diagnose performance issues and speed up your models" [1].

## Role in ML Workflows

- **Framework to Hardware Bridge**
  - Translate high-level model descriptions to executable code
  - Enable compatibility across diverse hardware accelerators
  - Abstract hardware-specific optimizations from ML practitioners
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Reduce inference latency and increase throughput
  - Improve resource utilization (memory, compute)
  - Enable efficient edge deployment

## Compiler Components

- **Front-end**
  - Ingests models from frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
  - Creates intermediate representation (IR)
  - Performs initial framework-specific optimizations
- **Middle-end**
  - Hardware-agnostic optimizations
  - Graph transformations and operator fusion
  - Memory layout planning
- **Back-end**
  - Hardware-specific code generation
  - Target-specific optimizations
  - Runtime support integration

## Why ML Compilers Matter

According to research from Stanford DAWN lab, typical ML workloads using NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow can run **23 times slower** in one thread compared to hand-optimized code [1]. ML compilers help address this gap through automated optimization.

ML compilers are becoming increasingly important as:
- More companies deploy ML to edge devices
- Hardware diversity continues to grow
- Performance requirements become more stringent
- The gap between ML frameworks and hardware needs bridging

As noted by Soumith Chintala, creator of PyTorch: "as the ML adoption matures, companies will compete on who can compile and optimize their models better" [1].

## Compiler Types

### Framework/Hardware Vendor Compilers
- **NVCC** (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler): Works only with CUDA, closed-source
- **XLA** (Accelerated Linear Algebra, Google): Originally for TensorFlow, now adopted by JAX
- **PyTorch Glow** (Facebook): For PyTorch models on various hardware

### Third-Party Compilers
- **Apache TVM**: Works with multiple frameworks and hardware backends
- **MLIR**: Meta compiler infrastructure that allows building custom compilers
