# Forward Diffusion Process

The forward diffusion process is a fundamental component of [[Diffusion Models Overview|diffusion models]] that gradually adds noise to data samples according to a fixed schedule.

## Core Concept

The forward diffusion process defines a Markov chain that gradually transforms a data point $\mathbf{x}_0$ into pure noise $\mathbf{x}_T$ over $T$ timesteps by adding small amounts of Gaussian noise at each step according to a variance schedule $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_T$.

## Mathematical Formulation

The forward process is defined as:

$$q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}_0$ is the original data point
- $\mathbf{x}_t$ is the noisy version of the data at timestep $t$
- $\beta_t$ is the noise schedule parameter at timestep $t$
- $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ represents a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

## Key Properties

### Reparameterization

A key mathematical property allows us to sample $\mathbf{x}_t$ at any arbitrary timestep directly from $\mathbf{x}_0$ without having to simulate the entire chain:

$$q(\mathbf{x}_t | \mathbf{x}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t) \mathbf{I})$$

Where:
- $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$
- $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$

This can be parameterized as:

$$\mathbf{x}_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \mathbf{x}_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \, \epsilon$$

Where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ is random Gaussian noise.

## Noise Schedule

The choice of the noise schedule $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_T$ is crucial for the performance of diffusion models. Common approaches include:

- **Linear schedule**: $\beta_t$ increases linearly from $\beta_1$ to $\beta_T$
- **Cosine schedule**: $\beta_t$ follows a cosine function for smoother transitions
- **Quadratic schedule**: $\beta_t$ follows a quadratic curve

The noise schedule is designed so that:
- $\beta_1$ is small enough to preserve most of the data structure initially
- $\beta_T$ is large enough to ensure $\mathbf{x}_T$ is approximately pure noise
- The intermediate steps provide a gradual transition

## Connection with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics

The forward diffusion process is related to Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), which is a technique that combines stochastic gradient descent with Langevin dynamics. This connection provides theoretical insights into why diffusion models work effectively.

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the forward diffusion process:
- The choice of $T$ (number of timesteps) affects both training stability and sampling speed
- Larger $T$ values provide finer-grained noise addition but require more computation
- Efficient implementations often use a pre-computed table of $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ and $\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}$ values
