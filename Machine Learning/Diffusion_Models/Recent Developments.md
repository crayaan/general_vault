# Recent Developments in Diffusion Models

The field of [[Diffusion Models Overview|diffusion models]] has evolved rapidly since its mainstream introduction in 2020. This note tracks key developments that represent significant advances in capability, efficiency, or application.

## Acceleration Techniques

One of the primary focuses has been addressing the slow sampling speed of diffusion models.

### Consistency Models

[[Consistency Models]] represent a breakthrough in diffusion model efficiency:

- **One-step generation**: Enables high-quality sample generation in a single step
- **Direct mapping**: Maps any point on a diffusion trajectory to its origin
- **Self-consistency**: All points on the same trajectory map to the same output

Consistency Models achieve competitive sample quality while being 10-50Ã— faster than traditional diffusion approaches.

### Progressive Distillation

[[Progressive Distillation]] iteratively distills knowledge from a teacher model to a student model that can generate samples with half the number of steps:

- **Halving steps**: Each distillation iteration reduces sampling steps by half
- **Preserved quality**: Maintains sample quality through the distillation process
- **Iterative improvement**: Can be applied multiple times to reach 4-8 step models

This technique forms the basis for many fast diffusion models in production today.

### Latent Space Diffusion

[[Latent Diffusion Models|Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)]] operate in a compressed latent space:

- **Reduced dimensionality**: Working in a compressed space reduces computational requirements
- **Perceptual compression**: Separates perceptual compression from semantic generation
- **Efficient conditioning**: Enables more efficient multi-modal conditioning
- **Practical deployment**: Enables models like Stable Diffusion to run on consumer hardware

### Differential Equation Solvers

Advanced numerical methods for solving the diffusion ODE/SDE:

- **DPM-Solver**: Fast ODE solver specifically designed for diffusion models
- **Heun samplers**: Second-order solvers that improve quality with fewer steps
- **Adaptive step size**: Methods that automatically adjust step size based on error

## Architectural Innovations

Architectural changes have improved both quality and capabilities.

### Diffusion Transformers

[[Diffusion Transformer|DiT]] replaces the traditional U-Net architecture with transformer blocks:

- **Transformer backbone**: Using self-attention instead of convolutions
- **Patch-based approach**: Operating on image patches rather than pixels
- **Scaling properties**: Better scaling with model size
- **Enhanced conditioning**: More flexible conditioning mechanisms

### ControlNet

[[ControlNet]] enables precise control over generation:

- **Control conditioning**: Adds spatial conditioning signals like edges, poses, or depth maps
- **Zero convolutions**: Special architectural element that stabilizes training
- **Architecture preservation**: Maintains pretrained weights while adding control

### Cascaded Diffusion

Cascaded approaches generate content at progressively higher resolutions:

- **Multi-stage pipeline**: Generate low-resolution images first, then upsample
- **Specialized models**: Different models optimized for different resolution levels
- **Better coherence**: Maintains global structure while adding fine details

## Conditioning Mechanisms

Advanced conditioning techniques have expanded what's possible with diffusion models.

### Classifier-Free Guidance

[[Classifier-Free Guidance]] improves sample quality without requiring a separate classifier:

- **Joint training**: Train conditional and unconditional models together
- **Guidance scale**: Control the trade-off between sample quality and diversity
- **Computational efficiency**: More efficient than classifier guidance

### Cross-Attention Conditioning

Sophisticated conditioning through cross-attention:

- **Modality bridging**: Effectively connecting text, image, or other modalities
- **Fine-grained control**: Attention maps provide detailed spatial guidance
- **Scaled conditioning**: Adjust influence of conditioning signals

### Regional Prompting

Methods for controlling different regions of an image independently:

- **Attention masking**: Restrict conditioning influence to specific regions
- **Segmentation-based**: Use semantic segmentation to guide generation
- **Multi-prompt techniques**: Apply different prompts to different image regions

## Multimodality and Unified Models

Recent models increasingly span multiple modalities.

### Generalist Models

Models that can work across different types of data:

- **Imagen 2**: Google's multimodal model for image and video
- **Sora**: OpenAI's advanced text-to-video diffusion model
- **Unified architectures**: Single models that can process various input and output types

### Video Diffusion

Extending diffusion models to video generation:

- **Temporal convolutions**: Extending spatial convolutions to the time dimension
- **Space-time factorization**: Separate spatial and temporal processing
- **Frame prediction**: Autoregressively predicting future frames

### 3D Content Generation

- **Neural fields**: Using diffusion to generate 3D neural representations
- **View synthesis**: Generating 3D content from multiple views
- **Score distillation**: Using 2D diffusion models to optimize 3D representations

Deeper theoretical understanding has improved model design and training.

### Unified Diffusion Framework

Unifications of various diffusion approaches:

- **Score-based generative modeling**: Connecting diffusion models with score-based approaches
