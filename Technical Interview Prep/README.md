- Essential data structures
- Common algorithm patterns
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Problem-solving strategies

### [[System Design Fundamentals|System Design]]
- Distributed systems concepts
- Scalability and reliability
- Database design
- API design

### [[Machine Learning Interview Topics|ML Concepts]]
- ML fundamentals
- Deep learning architectures
- Model optimization
- ML system design

### [[Compiler Design for ML|ML Compilers]]
- Compiler fundamentals
- ML-specific optimizations
- Hardware acceleration
- IR (Intermediate Representation)

## üéØ Study Plan
