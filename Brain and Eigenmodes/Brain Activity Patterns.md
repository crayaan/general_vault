# Brain Activity Patterns

Brain activity patterns refer to the spatiotemporal distributions of neural activity observed using various neuroimaging techniques. Understanding these patterns is central to neuroscience, and the concept of [[Brain Eigenmodes Overview]] provides a framework for interpreting their structure.

## Types of Activity Patterns

1.  **[[Resting State Networks]] (RSNs)**:
    -   Coherent patterns of spontaneous brain activity observed when an individual is at rest (not performing an explicit task).
    -   Typically identified using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) by correlating slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the BOLD signal across different brain regions.
    -   Examples include the Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network, and Executive Control Network.
    -   Research suggests RSNs closely resemble combinations of low-frequency [[Brain Eigenmodes Overview|brain eigenmodes]]. [\[1\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10340)

2.  **Task-Evoked Activity**:
    -   Patterns of increased or decreased neural activity specifically associated with performing a sensory, motor, or cognitive task.
    -   Can be studied with fMRI, EEG, MEG, etc.
    -   The eigenmode framework suggests task activity can also be represented as a specific combination (superposition) of underlying eigenmodes, potentially emphasizing certain modes over others compared to the resting state.

3.  **Neural Oscillations (Brain Waves)**:
    -   Rhythmic patterns of electrical activity generated by populations of neurons.
    -   Measured primarily with Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG).
    -   Characterized by different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).
    -   The spatial distribution of these oscillations across the scalp or cortex can be related to specific eigenmode patterns. [\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27157788/)

## Relation to Eigenmodes

The [[Brain Eigenmodes Overview|eigenmode framework]] posits that these diverse activity patterns are not entirely independent phenomena but rather different manifestations of the brain's underlying dynamics, constrained by [[The Connectome|its anatomical structure]].

-   Complex activity patterns can be decomposed into a weighted sum of the fundamental eigenmodes.
-   Different cognitive states or tasks might correspond to different weightings or combinations of these modes.
-   The eigenmodes provide a natural, structure-informed basis set for representing and analyzing brain activity, potentially more efficiently than purely spatial or frequency-based methods.

Essentially, the connectome defines the possible "harmonics" (eigenmodes), and ongoing brain activity represents which of these harmonics are currently "playing" and how strongly.
