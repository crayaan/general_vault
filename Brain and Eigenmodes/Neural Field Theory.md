Instead of modeling individual neurons, NFT treats populations as continuous fields, describing their average activity (mean-field) over space and time.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Continuum Approximation**: Neural tissue (like the cortex) is treated as a continuous medium, rather than a discrete network of individual cells. This allows the use of mathematical tools from continuum physics, like partial differential equations.\n2.  **Mean-Field Activity**: The state variables typically represent the average activity of large populations of neurons at a given spatial location (e.g., average membrane potential, average firing rate).\n3.  **Spatial Coupling**: NFT explicitly incorporates how activity at one point influences activity at other points. This coupling is often modeled via an integral over space, weighted by a **connectivity kernel** $K(r, r')$ that describes the strength and sign (excitatory/inhibitory) of connections between locations $r$ and $r'$.\n    -   Often, this kernel is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, depending only on the distance $|r - r'|$, frequently modelled as an exponential decay (Exponential Distance Rule - EDR) or a \"Mexican hat\" shape (local excitation, surround inhibition). [\\[1\\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06098-1)\n4.  **Temporal Dynamics**: Models incorporate the temporal dynamics of neuronal populations, including synaptic delays, membrane time constants, and firing rate responses.\n5.  **Integro-Differential Equations**: The resulting mathematical models are often expressed as integro-differential equations describing how the mean-field activity $A(r, t)$ evolves over space $r$ and time $t$. A simplified conceptual form might be:\n    $$ \\tau \\frac{\\partial A(r, t)}{\\partial t} = -A(r, t) + \\int_{\\Omega} K(r, r') S[A(r', t - \\delta(r, r'))] dr' + N(r, t) $$\n    where $\\tau$ is a time constant, $S[\cdot]$ is a sigmoid firing rate function, $\\delta$ represents propagation delays, and $N$ is noise or external input.\n\n## Connection to Brain Eigenmodes\n\nNFT provides a theoretical basis for the emergence and significance of [[Brain Eigenmodes Overview]].\n\n1.  **Predicting Eigenmodes**: By incorporating the brain's geometry (the domain $\\Omega$ of the integral) and assumptions about the connectivity kernel $K$, NFT predicts the existence of characteristic spatial patterns of activity – the eigenmodes. [\\[2\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27157788/)\n2.  **Eigenmodes as Solutions**: The spatial [[Mathematics of Brain Eigenmodes|eigenmodes (geometric or connectome)]] are often the natural spatial solutions (eigenfunctions) to the linearized versions of the NFT equations. They represent the standing or travelling wave patterns that the neural field can support based on its structure.\n3.  **Geometry vs. Connectivity**: NFT models can be formulated to emphasize either the detailed [[The Connectome|connectome structure]] (by using a complex, empirically derived kernel $K$) or the brain's overall [[Mathematics of Brain Eigenmodes|geometry]] (by using a simpler, distance-dependent kernel $K$ on a domain representing the cortex). This connects directly to the debate about whether geometric or connectome eigenmodes are more fundamental. [\\[1\\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06098-1)\n4.  **Explaining [[Brain Activity Patterns]]**: NFT simulations can show how interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations, under the constraints of the brain's structure and driven by noise, lead to spontaneous activity patterns that closely resemble observed resting-state networks, often explainable as superpositions of low-frequency eigenmodes. [\\[3\\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10340)\n\n## Key Developers and Models\n\nPioneering work in NFT applied to the brain includes models by Nunez, Wright, Liley, Jirsa, Haken, and Robinson, among others. [\\[1\\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06098-1) These models vary in complexity but share the core principles of continuum approximation and spatial coupling.\n\n## Significance\n\nNFT bridges the gap between microscopic neural properties and macroscopic brain activity patterns observed with techniques like EEG, MEG, and fMRI. It provides a powerful theoretical tool for understanding how structure gives rise to function and dynamics in the brain, with eigenmodes being a central concept in this understanding.\n\n---\n\n**References**:\n1.
