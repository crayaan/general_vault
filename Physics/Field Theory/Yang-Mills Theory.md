# Yang-Mills Theory

## Overview

Yang-Mills theory represents a fundamental framework in theoretical physics that generalizes Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism to non-abelian gauge symmetries. The theory emerges naturally from the [[Principle of Least Action]] when requiring local gauge invariance.

## Mathematical Framework

### Gauge Group Structure
- Gauge group $G$ with generators $T^a$
- Structure constants $f^{abc}$: $[T^a,T^b] = if^{abc}T^c$
- Gauge field $A_\mu^a$

### Yang-Mills Action
$$
S_{YM} = -\frac{1}{4}\int d^4x\, F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a\mu\nu}
$$

where the field strength is:
$$
F_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + gf^{abc}A_\mu^b A_\nu^c
$$

## Connection to Least Action

### Gauge Transformations
Under local gauge transformations:
$$
A_\mu \to U A_\mu U^{-1} + \frac{i}{g}U\partial_\mu U^{-1}
$$

### Equations of Motion
From [[Euler-Lagrange Equation]]:
$$
D_\mu F^{\mu\nu,a} = 0
$$

where $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative.
