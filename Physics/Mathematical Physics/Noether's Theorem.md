# Noether's Theorem

## Overview

Noether's Theorem is one of the most profound results in theoretical physics, establishing a fundamental connection between symmetries and conservation laws. It states that every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a conserved quantity.

## Mathematical Statement

For a system described by a [[Lagrangian]] $L(q, \dot{q}, t)$, if the action is invariant under a continuous transformation:

$$
q \rightarrow q + \epsilon\delta q
$$

then there exists a conserved quantity:

$$
Q = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\delta q
$$

where 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}Q = 0
$$

## Fundamental Symmetries and Conservation Laws

### Space Translation
- **Symmetry**: Invariance under spatial translation
- **Conservation Law**: [[Conservation of Linear Momentum]]
- **Mathematical Form**: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0 \implies p = \text{constant}$

### Time Translation
- **Symmetry**: Invariance under time translation
- **Conservation Law**: [[Conservation of Energy]]
- **Mathematical Form**: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = 0 \implies E = \text{constant}$

### Rotation
- **Symmetry**: Invariance under rotation
- **Conservation Law**: [[Conservation of Angular Momentum]]
- **Mathematical Form**: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} = 0 \implies L = \text{constant}$
