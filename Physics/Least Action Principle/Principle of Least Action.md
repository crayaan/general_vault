# Principle of Least Action

## Overview

The principle of least action is a fundamental variational principle that underlies much of physics, from classical mechanics to quantum field theory. It states that the path a physical system takes between two points is the one for which the [[Action (Physics)|action]] is stationary (usually minimized).

## Mathematical Foundation

### Action Integral
The action $S$ is defined as the time integral of the [[Lagrangian]]:

$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt
$$

where:
- $L$ is the Lagrangian
- $q$ represents generalized coordinates
- $\dot{q}$ represents generalized velocities
- $t$ is time

### [[Euler-Lagrange Equation]]
The principle leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0
$$

This equation provides the equations of motion for the system.
