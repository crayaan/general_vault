### [[What is RAG]]

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval with text generation capabilities of large language models.

Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on their trained knowledge, RAG systems:

- Retrieve relevant information from a document collection
- Use this retrieved context to generate more accurate and grounded responses
- Maintain references to source material, improving factual accuracy

Key benefits of RAG include:
- Reducing hallucinations in LLM outputs
- Providing up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
- Enabling domain-specific knowledge without full model retraining

### [[Document Processor Implementation]]

The Document Processor is responsible for:
1. Extracting text from documents (like PDFs)
2. Splitting text into manageable chunks
3. Creating embeddings for each chunk

Our implementation uses:
- `pypdf` for PDF text extraction
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for creating coherent text segments
- `SentenceTransformer` for generating embeddings

Key design principles:
- Clear separation of concerns between extraction, splitting, and embedding
- Explicit processing steps rather than complex one-liners
- Descriptive variable names that explain purpose
- Type hints for better code understanding

Code structure:
```python
class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str):
        # Initialize embedding model and text splitter
        
    def process_pdf(self, file_path: str) -> List[Dict]:
        # Extract text from PDF
        # Split text into chunks
        # Create embeddings
        # Return chunks with embeddings
```
