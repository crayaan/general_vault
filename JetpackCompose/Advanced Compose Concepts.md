# Advanced Compose Concepts

Deeper exploration of Jetpack Compose concepts for creating sophisticated UI components.

## Custom Layouts
- **Layout Composable**
  - Direct control over measurement and placement
  - Creating complex layouts not possible with standard components
  - Custom positioning and sizing logic
- **Example**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    Layout(
        content = content,
        modifier = modifier
    ) { measurables, constraints ->
        // Measure children
        val placeables = measurables.map { measurable ->
            measurable.measure(constraints)
        }
        
        // Place children
        layout(constraints.maxWidth, constraints.maxHeight) {
            placeables.forEach { placeable ->
                // Custom placement logic
                placeable.place(0, 0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Theming and Styling
- **MaterialTheme**
  - Consistent design system
  - Colors, typography, and shapes
  - Component-level theming
- **Custom Themes**
  - Creating brand-specific themes
  - Theme extensions
  - Dynamic theming (dark mode, etc.)
- **Explore [[Theming and Styling]]**

## Animations
- **Animation Types**
  - Single value animations
  - Visibility animations
  - Content transitions
  - Shared element transitions
- **Animation APIs**
  - `animate*AsState` functions
  - `AnimatedVisibility`
  - `AnimatedContent`
  - `Transition` API
- **Dive deeper in [[Animation in Compose]]**

## Effects and Side Effects
- **LaunchedEffect**
  - Coroutine-based side effects
  - Key-based restart
- **DisposableEffect**
  - Lifecycle-aware cleanup
  - Resource management
- **See [[Side Effects in Compose]]**
