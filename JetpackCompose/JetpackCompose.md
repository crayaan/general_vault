# Roadmap to Developing a UI Library in Jetpack Compose

Creating a UI library with Jetpack Compose involves mastering various concepts and skills. This roadmap guides you through the essential steps to achieve this goal.

## 1. Understand the Basics of Jetpack Compose

- **Learn Composable Functions**: Understand the `@Composable` annotation and how to build UI components declaratively.
- **Explore Modifiers**: Learn how to style and layout composables using modifiers.
- **Study State Management**: Understand how to manage UI state in a declarative framework.

## 2. Deep Dive into Advanced Compose Concepts

- **Custom Layouts**: Learn to create custom layouts using the `Layout` composable and understand measurement and placement of child components.
- **Theming and Styling**: Master theming using `MaterialTheme` and create custom themes for consistent UI design.
- **Animations**: Implement animations to enhance user experience.

## 3. Design Effective UI Components

- **API Design**: Focus on creating intuitive and flexible APIs for your UI components.
- **Modifier Usage**: Apply modifiers thoughtfully to ensure predictable behavior.
- **Component Reusability**: Design components that are reusable and customizable.

## 5. Develop and Publish Your UI Library

- **Set Up Your Project**: Configure your project for library development, including setting appropriate dependencies and build configurations.
- **Implement Components**: Develop your UI components, ensuring they are well-documented and tested.
- **Package and Distribute**: Package your library and publish it to a repository like Maven Central or GitHub Packages for public use.

By following this roadmap, you'll acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to create a robust and reusable UI library using Jetpack Compose.

# State Hoisting

A pattern for managing state in Jetpack Compose UI components.

## Core Concept
- **Definition**
  - Lifting state up to caller
  - Making components stateless
  - Enabling reusability
- **Benefits**
  - Single source of truth
  - Testability
  - Predictable behavior

## Implementation Pattern
- **Stateful vs Stateless**
  - Internal state (convenience)
  - Hoisted state (control)
  - Hybrid approaches
- **Parameter Structure**
  - Value parameter
  - On-change callback
  - Example: `value: T, onValueChange: (T) -> Unit`

## Example Implementation
```kotlin
// Stateless TextField
@Composable
fun CustomTextField(
    value: String, 
    onValueChange: (String) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    // other parameters
) {
    TextField(
        value = value,
        onValueChange = onValueChange,
        modifier = modifier
    )
}

// Usage with hoisted state
@Composable
fun Screen() {
    var text by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    
    CustomTextField(
        value = text,
        onValueChange = { text = it }
    )
}
```

## Common Patterns
- **Remember Helper**
  - Creating convenience wrappers
  - Providing both stateful and stateless versions
  - Example with default implementation
