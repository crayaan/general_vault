# Distributed Computing Fundamentals

Distributed computing involves multiple computing devices working together as a unified system. This paradigm is essential for P2P model parallelization, providing the theoretical foundation and practical techniques for coordinating computation across a network of peers.

## Core Principles

### System Models

- **Synchronous Systems**: Processes operate in lockstep with bounded communication delays
- **Asynchronous Systems**: No timing assumptions, processes operate at arbitrary speeds
- **Partially Synchronous Systems**: Behave asynchronously with synchronous periods
- **Failure Models**: Different assumptions about how processes can fail (crash, Byzantine)

### State and Consistency

- **Consistency Models**
  - **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same state at the same time
  - **Eventual Consistency**: Nodes converge to the same state if updates stop
  - **Causal Consistency**: Causally related operations are seen in the same order by all nodes
  - **Sequential Consistency**: Operations appear to occur in some sequential order

- **State Replication**
  - **Primary-Backup**: One primary node with backup replicas
  - **State Machine Replication**: Apply same operations in same order on all replicas
  - **Quorum-Based Replication**: Ensure read/write operations intersect
  - **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Data structures that automatically resolve conflicts

### Communication Patterns

- **Point-to-Point**: Direct communication between two nodes
- **Multicast**: Sending messages to a subset of nodes
- **Broadcast**: Sending messages to all nodes
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Nodes subscribe to topics and receive published messages
- **Gossip Protocols**: Information spreading through node-to-node epidemic communication

## Fundamental Algorithms and Mechanisms

### Time and Ordering

- **Logical Clocks**
  - **Lamport Clocks**: Scalar timestamps that preserve causal ordering
  - **Vector Clocks**: Vector timestamps that capture causal relationships accurately
  - **Hybrid Logical Clocks**: Combining physical and logical time

- **Distributed Snapshots**
  - **Chandy-Lamport Algorithm**: Recording consistent global states
  - **Causal Snapshots**: Preserving causal relationships in snapshots

### Consensus Mechanisms

- **Classic Consensus**
  - **Paxos**: Single-decree and multi-decree variants
  - **Raft**: Understandable consensus with leader election
  - **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**: Tolerating Byzantine failures

- **Blockchain Consensus**
  - **Proof of Work**: Computational puzzles to establish consensus
  - **Proof of Stake**: Stake-based validator selection
  - **Proof of Authority**: Authorized validators only

### Leader Election

- **Bully Algorithm**: Highest-ID node becomes leader
- **Ring-Based Election**: Token passing in a logical ring
- **Randomized Election**: Probabilistic approaches to leader election
- **Weighted Voting**: Vote counting based on node weights or capabilities

## P2P System Architecture

### Network Topologies

- **Structured P2P Networks**
  - **Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)**: Chord, Kademlia, Pastry
  - **Skip Lists and Skip Graphs**: Probabilistic hierarchical structures
  - **Content Addressable Networks**: Multi-dimensional coordinate spaces

- **Unstructured P2P Networks**
  - **Random Graphs**: Random connections between peers
  - **Small-World Networks**: Short average path lengths
  - **Super-peer Networks**: Hybrid with some peers having special roles

### Overlay Network Construction

- **Bootstrapping**: Initial peer discovery
- **NAT Traversal**: Techniques for connecting peers behind NATs
  - **STUN** (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)
  - **TURN** (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)
  - **ICE** (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
  - **Hole Punching**: Direct connection establishment techniques

- **Churn Management**: Handling peers joining and leaving
  - **Soft State**: Periodically refreshed state information
  - **Heartbeating**: Regular liveness checks
  - **Graceful Departure**: Orderly exit procedures

## Challenges in Distributed Systems

### Inherent Challenges

- **CAP Theorem**: Impossibility of simultaneously guaranteeing consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
- **FLP Impossibility**: Consensus is impossible in asynchronous systems with even one faulty process
- **Two Generals Problem**: Impossibility of consensus over unreliable channels
- **Byzantine Generals Problem**: Consensus with malicious actors

### Practical Challenges

- **Network Partitions**: Partial communication failure between nodes
- **Node Failures**: Processes crashing or behaving incorrectly
- **Performance Variability**: Inconsistent node performance
- **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Limits to system growth
- **Heterogeneity**: Diverse hardware and software environments

## Applications to P2P ML Systems

### Resource Discovery and Management

- **Capability Advertisement**: Peers announcing their computational resources
- **Resource Matchmaking**: Pairing computation needs with available resources
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adapting to changing resource availability

### Coordination Mechanisms

- **Distributed Schedulers**: Assigning work across the network
- **Barrier Synchronization**: Coordinating phase transitions
- **Work Stealing/Sharing**: Load balancing techniques
- **Distributed Locking**: Controlling access to shared resources

### Data Consistency and Model Convergence

- **Parameter Synchronization**: Ensuring model weights are properly combined
- **Stale Parameter Handling**: Dealing with outdated model fragments
- **Atomic Operations**: Ensuring operation atomicity in distributed settings
- **Convergence Guarantees**: Ensuring training leads to a coherent model
