# Model Parallelism Fundamentals

Model parallelism is a distributed computation approach where different parts of a machine learning model are assigned to different computing devices. This technique is essential for training and deploying large models that cannot fit into a single device's memory.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Parallelism in ML

- **Data Parallelism**: The same model is replicated across multiple devices, each processing different batches of data
- **Model Parallelism**: The model itself is split across multiple devices, with each device responsible for a portion of the model
	-  **Tensor Model Parallelism**: Individual tensors (layers, weights) are split across devices
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: The model is divided into sequential stages, with each stage assigned to a different device
- **Sequence Parallelism**: Sequences in transformer models are processed in parallel

## Model Parallelization Strategies

### Pipeline Parallelism

Pipeline parallelism partitions a model into sequential stages, with each stage assigned to a different device. This approach is particularly effective for models with a clear sequential flow.

Key characteristics:
- **Micro-batching**: Input data is divided into micro-batches that flow through the pipeline
- **Bubble overhead**: Time periods when some devices are idle due to pipeline filling/draining
- **Activation memory**: Activations must be stored between forward and backward passes
- **Implementations**: DeepSpeed Pipeline, GPipe, PipeDream

### Tensor Model Parallelism

In tensor model parallelism, individual tensors (typically large matrices in fully-connected or attention layers) are split across multiple devices.

Key characteristics:
- **Sharded matrices**: Large weight matrices are partitioned across devices
- **All-reduce communication**: Results must be combined through collective communications
- **Matrix-multiplication partitioning**: Different patterns for partitioning matrix multiplications
- **Implementations**: Megatron-LM, Colossal-AI

### Hybrid Parallelism

Modern large-scale systems often combine multiple forms of parallelism:

- **3D Parallelism**: Combines data, pipeline, and tensor parallelism (DeepSpeed)
- **FSDP + TP**: Fully Sharded Data Parallel with Tensor Parallelism
- **Sequence Parallelism + TP**: Divides both sequences and tensors across devices

## Challenges in Model Parallelism

### Communication Overhead

- **All-reduce operations**: Collective communication to combine results
- **Point-to-point transfers**: Direct communication between specific devices
- **Bandwidth limitations**: Network constraints affecting scaling
- **Latency impact**: Communication delays affecting overall performance

### Load Balancing

- **Computation imbalance**: Uneven workload distribution
- **Heterogeneous hardware**: Dealing with different device capabilities
- **Dynamic workloads**: Varying computational requirements across iterations
- **Memory constraints**: Different memory requirements for different model parts

### Memory Management

- **Activation checkpointing**: Trading computation for memory by recomputing activations
- **Offloading**: Moving tensors to CPU or NVMe storage when not in use
- **Mixed precision**: Using lower precision formats to reduce memory footprint
- **Memory-efficient attention**: Specialized algorithms for transformer attention mechanisms

## P2P Model Parallelism Considerations

Implementing model parallelism in a peer-to-peer setting introduces unique challenges:

- **Heterogeneous devices**: Accommodating widely varying compute capabilities
- **Unreliable nodes**: Handling device disconnections and failures
- **Network constraints**: Operating over unstable or low-bandwidth connections
- **Dynamic participation**: Adjusting to peers joining and leaving the network

## Applications and Use Cases

- **Large language models**: Training and serving models with billions of parameters
- **Computer vision models**: Distributed processing of large image/video models
- **Multi-modal models**: Parallelizing models that integrate different data types
- **Resource-constrained environments**: Enabling model execution across limited devices
