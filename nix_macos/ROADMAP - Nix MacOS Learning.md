### [[What is Nix]]

Nix is a powerful package manager and build system designed around the principles of functional programming, offering reproducible, declarative, and reliable software management.

Unlike traditional package managers, Nix stores packages in isolation within the Nix store (`/nix/store`), with each package having its own unique identifier based on all of its dependencies and configuration options.

Key features include:
- Atomic upgrades and rollbacks
- Multiple versions of packages coexisting
- Complete dependency isolation
- Reproducible builds
- Multi-user package management

### [[Installing Nix on macOS]]

Nix can be installed on macOS using several methods, each with its own advantages depending on your requirements and system configuration.

This guide walks through the installation process step-by-step, ensuring you'll have a working Nix installation optimized for your macOS environment.

Before beginning, be aware that Nix creates a dedicated volume on APFS filesystems to ensure proper functionality with macOS security features.

Step 1: Choose an installation method...
