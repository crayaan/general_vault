* see: [[StableHLO]], [[PJRT]]
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) takes models from frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX and optimizes them for efficient execution on various hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators. The project is now part of the broader OpenXLA initiative, built collaboratively by industry-leading ML hardware and software companies, including Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, AMD, Apple, Arm, Google, Intel, Meta, and NVIDIA.

## Key Benefits

- **Framework Compatibility**: XLA integrates with leading ML frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX
- **Hardware Portability**: Supports various backends including GPUs, CPUs, and specialized ML accelerators like [[Systolic Arrays|TPUs]]
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements production-tested optimization passes and automated model parallelism
- **Unified Toolchain**: Leverages [[MLIR Framework|MLIR]] to bring multiple capabilities into a single compiler infrastructure
- **Industry Collaboration**: Developed as an open-source project by major ML hardware and software vendors

## Architecture

### Compilation Pipeline

1. **Framework Frontend**: Translates TensorFlow/PyTorch/JAX operations to XLA HLO (High Level Optimizer)
2. **HLO Optimizations**: 
   - Graph-level transformations
   - Operator fusion
   - Layout optimization
   - Memory allocation planning
3. **Backend Code Generation**:
   - Target-specific lowering
   - Final code optimization
   - Native code generation

### HLO IR

XLA uses a High-Level Optimizer (HLO) Intermediate Representation that:
- Represents computations as graph operations
- Enables hardware-independent optimizations
- Serves as an abstraction layer between ML frameworks and hardware targets
- Facilitates analysis and transformation passes

## Integration with ML Frameworks

### TensorFlow Integration

- JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation through `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`
- Auto-clustering feature that automatically identifies subgraphs for XLA compilation
- AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation via `tfcompile` tool
- Relates to [[ML Compiler Frameworks|TensorFlow compiler infrastructure]]

### PyTorch Integration

- `torch.xla` package for PyTorch/XLA integration
- Transparent device placement via `xla_device`
- Support for distributed training through XLA's SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) capabilities
- Lazy tensor execution model

### JAX Integration

- First-class integration with JAX's functional programming model
- XLA serves as JAX's primary backend compiler
- JIT compilation through `jax.jit`
- Excellent support for [[Hardware-Aware Compilation|hardware-specific optimizations]]

## Optimization Techniques

XLA implements numerous [[Model Optimization Strategies|optimization strategies]] including:

### Graph-Level Optimizations

- **Operation Fusion**: Combining multiple operations to reduce memory traffic
- **Algebraic Simplification**: Mathematical transformations to simplify computation graphs
- **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identifying and reusing repeated computation patterns
- **Dead Code Elimination**: Removing unused operations from the computation graph

### Hardware-Specific Optimizations

- **Memory Layout Optimization**: Selecting optimal tensor layouts for specific hardware targets
- **Tiling and Blocking**: Breaking computations into hardware-efficient chunks
- **Instruction Selection**: Using specialized instructions (e.g., tensor cores on NVIDIA GPUs)
- **[[Systolic Arrays|Systolic Array]] Mapping**: Efficient mapping for TPU and similar architectures

## PJRT (Portable JAX Runtime)

PJRT is a key component that provides a unified runtime interface for XLA execution:

- Hardware abstraction layer for different backends (CPU, GPU, TPU)
- Support for device management and memory allocation
- Pluggable architecture for new hardware backends
- C++ and Python API for device interaction and execution control

## Use Cases

- **Training Large Models**: Optimizing performance for both single-device and distributed training
- **Inference Optimization**: Specialized compilation for deployment environments
- **Research Applications**: Easy experimentation with new hardware or model architectures
- **Production Deployment**: Cross-platform support for consistent performance

## Advanced Features

- **StableHLO**: A portable dialect evolved from XLA HLO, providing stability guarantees
- **Shardy**: Component for automated device mesh creation and sharding strategies
- **Auto-tuning**: Automated selection of optimal execution parameters
- **TPU-specific Optimizations**: Specialized passes for Google's Tensor Processing Units

## Relation to Other ML Compiler Projects

- Shares some design principles with [[TVM Compiler|TVM]] but focuses more on framework integration
- Leverages [[MLIR Framework|MLIR]] for modern compiler infrastructure
- Complements framework-specific optimizers like TorchDynamo and TorchInductor
- Part of broader [[Hardware-Aware Compilation|hardware-aware compilation]] ecosystem
