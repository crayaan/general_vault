README: Understanding Obsidian

Overview

Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to create internal links between notes and visualize these connections as a graph, facilitating a flexible and non-linear approach to organizing and structuring thoughts and knowledge.  ￼

Core Concepts

1. Markdown-Based Notes
	•	Plain-Text Markdown (.md) Files: Obsidian stores all notes as plain-text Markdown files, ensuring portability and future-proofing your data.
	•	Formatting Capabilities: Supports various formatting options, including headings, bold, italics, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, tables, images, and more.
	•	Example of Markdown Formatting:

# Title (H1)
## Subtitle (H2)
**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
> Blockquote
- Bullet list item
1. Numbered list item
`Inline code`

	•	Benefits:
	•	Simplicity: Markdown’s straightforward syntax makes it easy to learn and use.
	•	Compatibility: Markdown files can be opened and edited with any text editor, ensuring accessibility across different platforms.

2. Backlinks & Linkages
	•	Internal Links: Create connections between notes using double square brackets.

[[Note Title]]

	•	Backlinks: Obsidian automatically tracks which notes link to the current note, allowing for easy navigation and discovery of related content.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Networked Thought: Facilitates a web-like structure of information, mirroring the way humans naturally think and associate ideas.
	•	Contextual Understanding: Quickly access related notes to gain a deeper understanding of topics.

3. Graph View
	•	Interactive Visualization: Displays all notes and their interconnections as a dynamic graph.
	•	Features:
	•	Zoom & Pan: Explore different sections of your knowledge base with intuitive controls.
	•	Filters: Focus on specific tags or folders to analyze particular subsets of notes.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Macro Perspective: Understand the overall structure and density of your knowledge base.
	•	Discovery: Identify isolated notes or unexpected connections between topics.

4. Tags & Metadata
	•	Tags: Categorize notes using hashtags.

#tagname

	•	YAML Frontmatter: Add metadata at the beginning of notes for advanced categorization and functionality.

---
title: "My Note"
tags: ["machine-learning", "compilers"]
created: 2025-03-07
---


	•	Benefits:
	•	Organization: Easily group and filter notes based on tags or metadata.
	•	Automation: Leverage metadata for automated processes, such as generating summaries or indexes.

5. Folders vs. Links
	•	Folders: Traditional hierarchical organization of notes into directories.
	•	Links: Networked connections between notes, allowing for multiple contextual pathways.
	•	Approach:
	•	Hybrid Method: Combine folders for broad categories and links for specific associations.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Flexibility: Accommodates both structured and fluid organization styles.
	•	Redundancy Reduction: Minimizes duplication by linking related content instead of copying it.

6. Templates & Automation
	•	Templates: Predefined note structures to maintain consistency.
	•	Daily Note Template:

---
date: {{date}}
tags: ["daily-note"]
---
# Notes for {{date}}
## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
## Journal
- Thoughts:


	•	Automation: Utilize plugins like Templater to automate repetitive tasks, such as inserting dates or creating standard sections.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Efficiency: Reduces manual entry and ensures uniformity across notes.
	•	Productivity: Streamlines the note-taking process, allowing focus on content creation.

7. Plugins & Customization
	•	Core Plugins: Built-in features that can be enabled or disabled based on user preference.
	•	Community Plugins: User-contributed extensions that add new functionalities.
	•	Examples:
	•	Kanban: Implement Kanban boards for task management.
	•	Calendar: Integrate a calendar view to organize notes by date.
	•	Dataview: Create dynamic views and queries of your notes.
	•	Themes: Customize the appearance of Obsidian to match personal aesthetics or improve readability.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Personalization: Tailor the application to fit individual workflows and preferences.
	•	Extendability: Adapt the software to meet evolving needs without waiting for official updates.
