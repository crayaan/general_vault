# General Knowledge Vault

A comprehensive personal knowledge base maintained in Obsidian, containing structured notes across multiple domains including Nix package management, Machine Learning Compilers, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Jetpack Compose.

## Contents

This repository contains structured documentation on:

- **Nix on macOS**: Package management, system configuration, and development workflows optimized for Apple Silicon
- **Machine Learning Compilers**: Frameworks like XLA, MLIR, StableHLO, and PJRT with a focus on their architecture and optimization
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implementation strategies, vector databases, embeddings, and LLM integration
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI development, component design, and state management
- **Additional Topics**: Various other subjects as they're explored and documented

## Structure

The documentation is organized in an Obsidian-compatible format, with bidirectional links between related concepts:
